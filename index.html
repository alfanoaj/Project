    <p>The purpose of this project was write a script that could randomly select over 500 cities and gather historical weather data.  Once the data was collected, various different statistics were graphed to see if there was any correlation between the latitude of a city and the various weather conditions that occur.</p>
    <p>In the image above, we can see that the closer a city gets to the equator, the higher the maximum temperature is for that city.</p>
